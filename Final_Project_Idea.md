# Final Project Idea Selection and Use Case Scenarios

## Idea Pitch (100-150 words)

The idea pitch (short 100-150 word overview of the project idea)

## Description of Target Users

## What the Application Will Do 

### What data (from users, web, other sources, etc) will be needed

### What is the role of LLMs

## How it is Different

How your product will differ from both existing non-LLM powered systems in the domain and from just using a general purpose LLM for the task (e.g. Gemini, Claude or ChatGPT)

## Usage Scenarios

Each group member should create TWO USAGE SCENARIOS for the product. A usage scenario consists of:

Short description - e.g. 'Capturing my network of friends and family through chat interaction'

Narrative of scenario - e.g. 'The user will engage in a chat conversation with MyNetGPT and be prompted to talk about recent social interactions, activities and situations they have done with their friends and family. The LLM will build up a list of names from these chats and ask follow up questions about them. In the background the app is constructing an ego network where nodes are the names of the friends (with attributes for features like how long you've known them, how strong the relationship is, what the individual likes/dislikes, how often you see them etc) and edges between the nodes based on imputing relationships like "A knows B", "A socializes with C" etc. from the chat history'

Step by step break down of the interaction - you can do this with bullet points and/or a Mermaid Sequence Diagram
Data description - what data is:
Needed for the app/LLM to engage and complete this scenario (be specific about the type of data, how it will be provided to the LLM etc)
Created as a result of the interaction, e.g. as a result of the 'tell me about your social interactions' scenario, a data structure (i.e. a network data structure) will be built and updated 

Evaluation - how will you test whether the application has successfully completed the scenario and what possible complications, errors should you consider (e.g. what happens if the input from the user is unexpected or adversarial etc)
