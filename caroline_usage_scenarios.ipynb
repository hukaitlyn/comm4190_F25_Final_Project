    "## Usage Scenario 1 — Weather-Based Run Adaptation and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Short Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "RunMate detects extreme weather and helps users adapt their scheduled runs safely while keeping motivation high.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Narrative of Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "The user planned an outdoor tempo run, but it’s pouring rain. RunMate proactively sends: “Rain alert! Want to switch to an indoor cross-training plan?” The LLM suggests treadmill equivalents or a home HIIT circuit matching the intended training load, and provides upbeat motivation (“Elite runners cross-train, don't think it doesn't count!”). After completion, it logs the session as equivalent aerobic time and adjusts the rest of the week’s schedule to keep total volume balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the weather clears unexpectedly, it can reverse the plan, prompting: “Conditions look better now—want to move your long run to today instead?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weather API detects poor conditions before scheduled run.\n",
    "* RunMate notifies user via chat.\n",
    "* User: “Ugh, it’s raining—should I skip today?”\n",
    "* LLM checks plan: today = tempo run.\n",
    "* LLM suggests: “Try 35 min treadmill at easy pace or indoor circuit.”\n",
    "* User completes session and logs perceived effort.\n",
    "* RunMate updates plan to maintain weekly training load.\n",
    "\n",

    "WeatherAPI-->>RunMate: Rain alert\n",
    "RunMate->>User: \"Bad weather, reschedule?\"\n",
    "User->>RunMate: \"Yes, what’s the alternative?\"\n",
    "RunMate->>LLM: Query plan + weather context\n",
    "LLM-->>RunMate: Suggest indoor replacement\n",
    "RunMate->>User: \"Do treadmill 35 min easy pace\"\n",
    "User->>RunMate: Confirms + logs completion\n",
    "RunMate->>Database: Adjust training log + update weekly plan\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Data Description**\n",
    "\n",

    "* Weather API feed (temperature, precipitation).\n",

    "* Gym access or home-equipment info (boolean flags).\n",

    "* Adjusted workout log (tagged “indoor substitute”).\n",
    "* Updated weekly schedule JSON.\n",
    "* Context notes for future adaptation (“rainy-day alternative worked well”).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detects unsafe or low-motivation conditions correctly.\n",
    "* Suggests equivalent training load (≤ ±10 % effort).\n",
    "* Maintains user streak and morale (positive sentiment).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complications**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Incorrect weather detection → fallback manual confirmation.\n",
    "* User lacks treadmill access → offers bodyweight circuit.\n",
    "* Adversarial input (“I’ll run in a thunderstorm anyway”) → LLM reminds of safety.\n",

    "## Usage Scenario 2 — Post-Run Reflective Journal and Goal Adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Short Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing a training cycle, the runner engages in a reflective conversation with RunMate to analyze progress, extract emotional insights, and set new goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Narrative of Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "The user has just finished an 8-week 10K plan. They message RunMate: “I can’t believe I actually did it!” The LLM congratulates them and prompts reflection: “What part of training felt most rewarding?” The user describes early-morning runs that built discipline. The LLM performs sentiment and keyword analysis to detect motivation drivers (community runs, consistency) and challenges (nutrition, fatigue). It summarizes strengths and growth areas, then proposes new seasonal goals—perhaps a half-marathon or improving pace. The app generates a new adaptive plan and a short journal entry with highlights from the chat.\n",

    "* LLM: “Amazing! What are you proudest of?”\n",
    "* User: “That I stuck with morning runs.”\n",

    "* LLM: “Anything you’d like to improve next time?”\n",
    "* User: “Maybe nutrition and hill workouts.”\n",
    "* LLM summarizes insights → generates reflective journal entry.\n",
    "* LLM suggests next goal → “Half-marathon in spring or faster 10K?”\n",

    "* Overly negative tone → LLM prioritizes encouragement before planning.\n",
    "* Data gaps in training log → LLM fills with user clarification."
