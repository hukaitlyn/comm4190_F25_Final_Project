Caroline Cummings, Kaityn Hu, Emily Lo

RunMate is an AI-powered running companion that transforms every workout into a motivating conversation. Designed for anyone who struggles with consistency or confidence, RunMate offers personalized running plans, pacing advice, and encouragement before, during, and after each run. By chatting naturally with users about their goals, schedule, or even the weather, it acts as a supportive coach and teammate rolled into one. Whether it’s creating a beginner 5K plan, suggesting recovery stretches, or celebrating milestones, RunMate makes training safer, smarter, and more social. helping runners stay consistent while having fun. The app adapts to each runner's fitness level and preferences, providing guidance that feels personal rather than robotic. From first-time joggers to experienced marathoners, RunMate helps athletes stay consistent, avoid injury, and enjoy the journey!
