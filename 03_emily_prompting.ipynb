    "NARRATIVE: The user has never run consistently but wants to complete their first 5K race in two months. They open RunMate and begin a conversational onboarding. The coach asks initial questions to understand the user’s current activity level, past running attempts, time availability, and goals. The coach then validates their goal as achievable and creates a progressive training plan. The coach guides and supports the user throughout their preparation, checking in regularly and adjusting the plan as needed based on progress. Follow these steps in order:\n",

    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Absolutely! This plan is designed to build your endurance and confidence gradually, leading up to your 5K. By progressively increasing your jog intervals and allowing for proper rest, you’ll be well-prepared on race day. Remember, the key is consistency and listening to your body.\n",

    "1. **Set Short-term Goals**: Celebrate small victories, like completing this week’s workouts, to keep motivation high.\n",

    "yes i’m ready! how much time should I have in between sessions?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Great to hear that you’re ready! It's important to give your body time to recover between sessions, especially as you're starting out. Here’s a general guideline for spacing out your training days:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're training three days a week, you could plan your sessions with a rest day in between each, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Day 1**: Training session (e.g., Monday)\n",
    "- **Day 2**: Rest or light activity\n",
    "- **Day 3**: Training session (e.g., Wednesday)\n",
    "- **Day 4**: Rest or light activity\n",
    "- **Day 5**: Training session (e.g., Friday)\n",
    "- **Days 6-7**: Rest or cross-training\n",
    "\n",
    "This schedule allows your muscles time to recover and adapt to your training, reducing the risk of injury and helping you to stay fresh and motivated for each session.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does that spacing plan sound to you? Do you think it fits into your week?\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "yes looks good to me\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Fantastic! I'm glad the schedule works for you. You're all set to begin your journey to the 5K race with a plan that supports both your goals and recovery. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you take on your first session, remember to enjoy each step of the process and listen to your body. I'll touch base with you soon to see how everything is going. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you need advice or encouragement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wishing you the best for your first session! How are you feeling about kicking off your training? Any final thoughts or questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "No thank you!\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "You're very welcome! I'm excited for you to begin this journey and confident that you'll do great. Remember, I'm here whenever you need support or motivation. Enjoy your first training session, and I'll check in with you soon to see how it's going. Happy running! 🏃‍♂️💨\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "The success criteria outlined previously was:\n",
    "- LLM identifies fitness level correctly (“maybe 5 minutes” → beginner)\n",
    "- Plan matches constraints (3 days/week, 30 min, 8 weeks)\n",
    "- Progressive structure\n",
    "- Encouraging tone without dismissiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, the LLM accomplished all of these criteria and was very helpful even when faced with concern from the user. \n"

    "Instead, let me suggest a proper taper plan for your remaining days:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monday (today):** If you haven't run yet, a very easy 2-mile run at a comfortable, conversational pace is perfect. This keeps your legs moving without creating fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuesday:** Complete rest (light walking is fine if you're feeling restless)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wednesday:** Complete rest (again, light walking okay)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thursday:** Complete rest (light walking okay)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Friday:** 15-minute very easy shakeout jog with 3-4 short 20-second pickups at race pace to keep your legs feeling springy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Saturday:** Race day! You'll be rested and ready to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "I promise you won't lose any fitness during this taper. It takes 2-3 weeks of inactivity to lose conditioning, so these few days of rest will only help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's your goal time for the race? I'd love to help you with a pacing strategy that matches your training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Won't I lose fitness if I rest that much?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "## RunMate Coach\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a really common concern, and I completely understand why you'd worry about that! But I can confidently reassure you that you will not lose any fitness during this short taper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The science on this is actually quite clear: it takes about 2-3 weeks of complete inactivity before you start to see any meaningful decline in your running fitness. What we're talking about here is just 5-6 days of reduced activity—not even complete rest—and that's nowhere near enough time to lose the conditioning you've built over 12 solid weeks of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's actually happening during this taper is something remarkable:\n",
    "- Your muscles are repairing micro-damage from training\n",
    "- Your glycogen stores (muscle energy) are being fully replenished\n",
    "- Your hormonal balance is optimizing\n",
    "- Your neuromuscular system is getting sharper\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these processes require rest to complete. Think of it like this: you've been making withdrawals from your energy bank for 12 weeks. This week, you're making deposits so you can spend it all on race day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many runners actually find they feel stronger and faster after a proper taper. That's why elite marathoners and Olympic runners all incorporate tapering—it's not just to avoid injury, it's because it scientifically improves performance!\n",
    "\n",
    "Would it help to know what you might expect to feel during this taper week? Many runners experience some interesting sensations that are actually positive signs but can feel concerning if you don't know what they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Yes I’m feeling nervous\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "## RunMate Coach\n",
    "\n",
    "Those nervous feelings are completely valid, and I'm glad you're sharing them with me. Pre-race nerves are not only normal—they're actually beneficial when channeled properly!\n",
    "\n",
    "During taper week, you might experience some interesting sensations that can sometimes increase anxiety if you don't know they're normal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phantom pains or niggles**: Little aches that seem to appear out of nowhere. These are usually just your body healing small issues that you didn't notice during harder training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Excess energy or restlessness**: You might feel jittery or have trouble sleeping. This is your body storing up energy for race day!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Doubt or anxiety dreams**: Many runners report dreams about missing the start or getting lost on the course. This is just your brain processing the importance of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feeling sluggish on short runs**: If you do the Friday shakeout run, you might feel heavy-legged. This often happens right before you feel amazing on race day.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these sensations are your body's way of preparing for peak performance. They're good signs!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ways to manage the nervous energy this week:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Spend 5-10 minutes each day imagining yourself running strong and confident\n",
    "- **Light stretching or yoga**: Helps calm the mind and body\n",
    "- **Write down your race plan**: Having it on paper can reduce mental loops\n",
    "- **Limit caffeine**: It can amplify anxiety\n",
    "- **Focus on your breathing**: Deep belly breaths activate your parasympathetic nervous system\n",
    "\n",
    "What's your goal for this 10K? Having a clear race strategy can help channel those nerves into positive energy!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "I want to finish under 60 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "## RunMate Coach\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a fantastic goal for your first 10K! Under 60 minutes means running at approximately a 9:40 per mile pace, which is very achievable with your 12 weeks of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me help you with a specific pacing strategy that will set you up for success:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Race Strategy for Sub-60 Minute 10K:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First 2 miles (Miles 1-2):** Start at around 10:00/mile pace\n",
    "   - This slightly conservative start prevents burning too much energy early\n",
    "   - You'll feel like you could go faster—that's perfect!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Middle miles (Miles 3-5):** Settle into your 9:40/mile target pace\n",
    "   - Find your rhythm here\n",
    "   - Focus on steady, comfortable breathing\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final mile (Mile 6+):** If you're feeling strong, gradually increase your effort\n",
    "   - This is where your taper pays off—fresh legs to finish strong!\n",
    "   - Use whatever you have left in the final 0.2 miles\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"negative split\" approach (running the second half slightly faster than the first) is proven to be the most effective racing strategy. It helps you avoid the common mistake of starting too fast and struggling later.\n",
    "\n",
    "For race day logistics, here's your plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Night before:**\n",
    "- Eat a normal dinner with familiar foods (nothing spicy or unusual)\n",
    "- Lay out your race clothes, bib, and shoes\n",
    "- Charge any devices you'll use\n",
    "- Aim for an early bedtime, but don't worry if you can't sleep well—one night's sleep doesn't affect performance much\n",
    "\n",
    "**Race morning:**\n",
    "- Wake up about 2-3 hours before race time\n",
    "- Light, familiar breakfast (toast with peanut butter, banana, etc.)\n",
    "- Sip water regularly but don't overhydrate\n",
    "- Arrive at the race site 45-60 minutes early\n",
    "- 10-15 minutes of very easy jogging as a warmup about 20-30 minutes before start\n",
    "- A few dynamic stretches (leg swings, high knees, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the golden rule: Nothing new on race day! Wear what you've trained in, eat what you know works for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this plan sound? I'll be here to check in with you each day this week to see how you're feeling and answer any questions that come up!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "This plan sounds good. Is there anything else I should know?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "## RunMate Coach\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm glad the plan resonates with you! Here are some additional important tips that will help make your race day experience even better:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mental Preparation:**\n",
    "- Prepare for tough moments - they happen in every race. Have a mantra ready like \"strong and steady\" or \"I've trained for this\"\n",
    "- Break the race into smaller segments mentally - focus on getting to the next mile marker rather than the full distance\n",
    "- Remember your \"why\" - connect with your motivation for running this race when things get challenging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Preparations:**\n",
    "- Check the weather forecast on Friday and adjust your outfit if needed\n",
    "- Pin your bib to your shirt the night before (usually on the front)\n",
    "- If the race provides a timing chip, make sure it's properly attached\n",
    "- Consider writing your target mile splits on your arm or a small card\n",
    "\n",
    "**Race Day Logistics:**\n",
    "- Use the bathroom before the race (lines get long, so allow time for this)\n",
    "- Position yourself appropriately at the start line - if you're aiming for under 60 minutes, you'll likely want to be in the middle of the pack\n",
    "- Don't weave excessively around other runners - it wastes energy\n",
    "- If water stations are available, practice grabbing water while maintaining your pace\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-Race:**\n",
    "- Keep moving after you cross the finish line - a slow walk helps prevent blood pooling\n",
    "- Hydrate and get some easily digestible carbs and protein within 30 minutes\n",
    "- Celebrate your achievement! Take photos, collect your medal if there is one\n",
    "- Plan a proper meal for later in the day to refuel\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Unexpected:**\n",
    "- If you need to tie your shoe or make an adjustment, move to the side of the course\n",
    "- If you feel a potential injury during the race, it's okay to slow down or walk\n",
    "- Trust your training - even if you feel doubtful, your body remembers all the work you've done\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll check in with you tomorrow to see how you're feeling and answer any new questions. Remember, at this point, less is more. Your job now is to rest, fuel well, and trust the training you've completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've got this! I'm excited to hear how it goes on Saturday!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "The success criteria for this scenario was:\n",
    "- Detects pre-race anxiety and validates feelings\n",
    "- Prevents common taper mistakes (overtraining)\n",
    "- Provides science-based taper plan (progressive rest)\n",
    "- Generates realistic pacing strategy based on training data\n",
    "- Reduces user anxiety (sentiment shifts from anxious to confident)\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM was able to do all of these effectively and calm down the user. "
