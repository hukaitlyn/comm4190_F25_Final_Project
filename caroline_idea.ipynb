    "This chatbot is a friendly AI running coach that turns every jog into a conversation. Many runners—especially students balancing busy schedules—struggle with staying motivated and knowing how to train safely and effectively. RunMate uses a large language model to deliver personalized running plans, pre-run pep talks, and post-run reflections in a natural, conversational way. By chatting with users about their goals, energy levels, or even the weather, it offers encouragement, pacing tips, and recovery reminders—like having a supportive coach and teammate in your pocket."
